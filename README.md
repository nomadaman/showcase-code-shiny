# showcase-code-shiny
This repo covers the showcasing of a shiny project with google trends library with some text mining use cases.


- Rstudio is required to run it
- Two files ie ui and server to run a shiny app using R
- Gtrends library is used and few other libraries for visualisations/data


- On a side note once these files are downloaded, we need to set the working directory to the folder where the file resides.
- Once the working directory has been set, app can be accessed by running it using green play button in the Rstudio.
- Otherwise if just need to check the functionality then this url can be used as it has been published already using shinyio.


Note: Dashboards add value to the data and gives more understanding to the end user using it.
